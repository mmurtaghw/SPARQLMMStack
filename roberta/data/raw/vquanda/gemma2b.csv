Question: Count the number of people became famous for when Andrew Jackson was a commander ?
Answer: 
```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(?person) AS ?count)
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Person .
  ?person dbo:becameFamous ?fame .
  FILTER(?fame = ""Andrew Jackson Commander"")
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>` : Defines the DBpedia Ontology namespace.
   - `prefix p: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>` : Defines the DBpedia Property namespace.

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `SELECT (COUNT(?person) AS ?count)`: Selects the count of all `?person` entities and assigns it to the variable `?count`.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?person a dbo:Person`: Matches entities with the `dbo:Person` class.
   - `?person dbo:becameFamous ?fame`: Matches entities with the `dbo:becameFamous` property and its associated value.
   - `FILTER(?fame = ""Andrew Jackson Commander"")`: Filters the results to only include entities where the `?fame` property is equal to ""Andrew Jackson Commander"".


This query retrieves the number of people who became famous while Andrew Jackson was a commander.

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify relevant properties:**
   - `wdt:P31`: Represents the ""nationality"" property.
   - `wdt:P17`: Represents the ""constituency"" property.

2. **Structure the query:**
   - The query uses a `SELECT` clause to retrieve the value of the `?constituency` variable.
   - The `WHERE` clause contains a triple pattern that matches the subject (Domenico Modugno) and its ""nationality"" and ""constituency"" properties.

3. **Use SPARQL syntax:**
   - `?subject`: Represents the variable to be used for the subject of the query.
   - `wdt:P31`: Represents the ""nationality"" property.
   - `wdt:P17`: Represents the ""constituency"" property.
   - `wd:Q1047777`: Represents the DBpedia URI for ""Domenico Modugno"".
   - `?constituency`: Represents the variable to be used for the value of the ""constituency"" property.

4. **Retrieve unique results:**
   - The query uses a triple pattern that matches the subject and its properties.
   - The `WHERE` clause ensures that only one result is returned.

Answer: I need to know the name of the music composer and the movie title.


```sparql
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

WHERE {
  ?composer dbo:created ?creationDate .
  ?composer dbo:musicFor ?movieTitle .
  FILTER (?creationDate > ""2000-01-01""^^xsd:date)
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo), RDF Schema (rdfs), and our example ontology (ex). This makes the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the values of the `composer` and `movieTitle` properties.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query. It contains the following statements:
   - **?composer dbo:created ?creationDate:** This statement retrieves the composer's creation date.
   - **?composer dbo:musicFor ?movieTitle:** This statement retrieves the movie titles for which the composer created music.
   - **FILTER (?creationDate > ""2000-01-01""^^xsd:date):** This filters the results to only include movies created after 2000.

**Note:** This query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph contains information about composers and their music for movies.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?city`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
   - **`?school a dbo:School`:** This line defines the subject of our query as a `dbo:School` resource.
   - **`?school dbo:district ?district`:** This line links the school to its district using the `dbo:district` property.
   - **`FILTER (?district = ""Mumbai Suburban"")`:** This line filters the results to only include schools with the district ""Mumbai Suburban"".
   - **`?school dbo:location ?location`:** This line links the school to its location using the `dbo:location` property.
   - **`?location dbo:city ?city`:** This line links the location to its city using the `dbo:city` property.

Question: What is the field of interest of the advisor of Henri Maspero ?
Answer: I am unable to answer this question. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify relevant properties:** We need to find the advisor of Henri Maspero and then find the field of interest of that advisor.
2. **Structure the query:**
    - Use the `prefix` directive to define the prefixes for DBpedia.
    - Use the `SELECT` clause to specify the data we want to retrieve.
    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the relationships between the entities.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbp:`, `rdf:`, `dbo:`, and `owl:`.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT` to retrieve the count of ingredients. We use `(?count) AS ?count` to assign the count to a variable named `?count`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** We use `WHERE` to specify the conditions for the query.
   - `?food a dbo:Food`: This line selects all entities that are instances of the `dbo:Food` class.
   - `?food dbo:hasIngredient ?ingredient`: This line selects all entities that have an ingredient property.
   - `FILTER (?ingredient = ""Pork"")`: This line filters the results to only include entities where the `?ingredient` property is equal to ""Pork"".

This query will return a single value representing the number of ingredients in the DBpedia Knowledge Graph that are ""Pork"".

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person dbo:name ""William Deaner"" .

```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes in the query.
2. **SELECT:** We use the `SELECT` clause to specify that we want to retrieve a single variable, which we'll call `?person`.
3. **WHERE:** The `WHERE` clause contains the main logic of the query.
4. **?person dbo:name ""William Deaner"" .**: This line specifies that we are looking for a person whose name is ""William Deaner"" and uses the `dbo:name` property.
5. **?person dbo:name ""Mark Latham"" .**: This line specifies that we are looking for a person whose name is ""Mark Latham"" and uses the `dbo:name` property.
6. **FILTER (?person = ?person1)**: This line filters the results to ensure that we only retrieve the person who is common to both names.

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `?show` is a variable that will hold the name of the television show.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?show dbo:developer ?developer` retrieves the television show's developer.
   - `FILTER (regex(?developer, ""J. Michael Straczynski"", ""i""))` filters the results to only include developers whose name contains ""J. Michael Straczynski"".

**How it works:**

The query searches for a television show (`?show`) where the developer (`?developer`) is a person with the name ""J. Michael Straczynski"". The `regex` function ensures that the developer's name is matched exactly.

  FILTER (regex(?country, ""United States"", ""i""))
  FILTER (regex(?country, ""Japan"", ""i""))

```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:`: Represents the DBpedia ontology.
   - `ex:`: Represents an example ontology (not used in the query).

2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?country:**
   - This clause specifies that we want to retrieve unique country names.

3. **WHERE clause:**
   - `?company dbo:flourished ?country`: This is the main query pattern. It searches for triples where the subject is a company (represented by `?company`) and the predicate is `dbo:flourished` (which indicates flourishing) and the object is a country (`?country`).
   - `FILTER (regex(?country, ""United States"", ""i""))`: This filter ensures that only countries containing ""United States"" in their name are returned.
   - `FILTER (regex(?country, ""Japan"", ""i""))`: This filter ensures that only countries containing ""Japan"" in their name are returned.
   - `FILTER (regex(?country, ""Germany"", ""i""))`: This filter ensures that only countries containing ""Germany"" in their name are returned.

**Note:** This query assumes that the DBpedia knowledge graph contains information about Pioneer Corporation and its flourishing locations.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `prefix dbp <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>` and `prefix rdf <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>`.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?show) AS ?count)` to retrieve the count of shows.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?show a :Show` : This line specifies that we are looking for entities that are labeled as ""Show"" in DBpedia.
   - `?show :hasSisterStation ?sisterStation` : This line specifies that we are looking for shows that have a sister station.
   - `?sisterStation a :Station` : This line specifies that we are looking for the sister station.
   - `?sisterStation :isSisterOf ?network` : This line specifies that we are looking for the sister station of a network.
   - `FILTER(?network = ""Cartoonite"")` : This line filters the results to only include shows that have a sister station that is ""Cartoonite"".


This query effectively counts the number of shows that have a sister station that is ""Cartoonite"".

SELECT ?state
WHERE {
  ?bridge dbo:location ?location .
  FILTER regex(?location, ""Colemanville Covered Bridge"", ""i"")

```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and DBpedia Resource (dbp) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?state`.
3. **WHERE:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
   - **?bridge dbo:location ?location:** This line retrieves the location of the bridge using the `dbo:location` property.
   - **FILTER regex(?location, ""Colemanville Covered Bridge"", ""i""):** This filters the results to only include locations that contain the exact phrase ""Colemanville Covered Bridge"" in their text.
   - **?location dbp:state ?state:** This line retrieves the state associated with the location using the `dbp:state` property.

This query effectively searches for the bridge's location, filters for the specific bridge name, and then extracts the state from the location's associated DBpedia resource.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (`dbo:`) and DBpedia Resource (`dbp:`) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?location` variable, which represents the location where Henri, Duke of Rohan was laid to rest.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - `?person dbo:deathPlace ?location` : This line retrieves the `deathPlace` property of the `?person` entity.
   - `FILTER ( regex(?location, ""Rohan"", ""i"") )`: This filters the results to only include locations containing the word ""Rohan"" in the query.
   - `FILTER ( regex(?location, ""France"", ""i"") )`: This further filters the results to only include locations containing the word ""France"" in the query.

This query effectively searches for the `deathPlace` of Henri, Duke of Rohan and filters the results to include locations that match the criteria of ""Rohan"" and ""France"".

SELECT ?party
WHERE {
  ?person dbo:childOf ?parent .
  ?parent dbo:person ?person .
  ?person dbo:politicalParty ?party .
  FILTER (?parent = dbo:SoniaGandhi)
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?party`, which will represent the name of the political party.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - **?person dbo:childOf ?parent:** This line identifies the relationship between a person (`?person`) and their parent (`?parent`).
   - **?parent dbo:person ?person:** This line ensures that the parent is indeed a person.
   - **?person dbo:politicalParty ?party:** This line identifies the political party of the person (`?person`).
   - **FILTER (?parent = dbo:SoniaGandhi):** This line filters the results to only include the political party of Sonia Gandhi's children.


This query effectively retrieves the political party associated with the children of Sonia Gandhi based on the relationships and properties defined in the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.

SELECT ?name ?area
WHERE {
  ?physician dbo:name ?name .
  ?physician dbo:areaOfExpertise ?area .
  FILTER (regex(?area, ""Veterinary"", ""i""))
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:`: Represents the DBpedia ontology.
   - `ex:`: Represents an example ontology (you can replace this with your own ontology if needed).

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `?name ?area`: Selects the subject (name) and object (area of expertise) of the relationship.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?physician dbo:name ?name .`: Matches entities with the DBpedia property `dbo:name` and retrieves the name.
   - `?physician dbo:areaOfExpertise ?area .`: Matches entities with the DBpedia property `dbo:areaOfExpertise` and retrieves the area of expertise.
   - `FILTER (regex(?area, ""Veterinary"", ""i""))`: Filters the results to only include areas of expertise that contain the word ""Veterinary"" (case-insensitive).

**Key Points:**

- The query uses the DBpedia ontology (`dbo:`) for retrieving information about individuals and their areas of expertise.
- The `regex` function is used to filter the results based on the presence of the word ""Veterinary"" in the area of expertise.
- The query retrieves unique results by using the `FILTER` clause.

Question: Who gives the license of WXXV-DT2?
Answer: The license of WXXV-DT2 is given by the **WXXV-DT2** entity.


```sparql
SELECT ?licenseHolder
WHERE {
  ?licenseHolder wdt:P31 wd:Q10477777 .
  ?licenseHolder wdt:P31 wdt:P1101 ?license .
  FILTER (?license = ""WXXV-DT2"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and for the WDT property: `wdt:`
2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the variable `?licenseHolder` which will hold the answer.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - **`?licenseHolder wdt:P31 wd:Q10477777`**: This line retrieves the entity that holds the license. The `wdt:P31` property represents the ""license holder"" property. `wd:Q10477777` is the DBpedia identifier for the WXXV-DT2 entity.
   - **`?licenseHolder wdt:P31 wdt:P1101 ?license`**: This line retrieves the actual license information. `wdt:P1101` is the property that represents the ""license"" itself.
   - **`FILTER (?license = ""WXXV-DT2"")`**: This line filters the results to only include instances where the license is ""WXXV-DT2"".


This query effectively retrieves the entity that holds the license of WXXV-DT2.

   - `prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>`
   - `prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> `
   - `prefix ex: <http://example.org/ontology/>` 
2. **SELECT Clause:** We want to retrieve three values:
   - `?role`: The role the saxophone player has been cast in.
   - `?actor`: The saxophone player's name.
   - `?work`: The work (e.g., movie, play, etc.) they were cast in.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause specifies the conditions for matching results:
   - `?actor a dbo:Saxophonist`: We're looking for actors who are of type ""Saxophonist"" according to DBpedia's ontology.
   - `?actor ?role ?work`: We're looking for instances where the actor has a role and that role is associated with a work.
   - `FILTER (?work != ""Unknown"")`: We only want to retrieve results where the work is not ""Unknown"".

Question: Count all the universities who participated in the tournament won by Alabama Crimson Tides in 2015 ?
Answer: 
```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(?university) AS ?count)
WHERE {
  ?university a dbo:University .
  ?university dbo:participatedIn ?tournament .
  FILTER(?tournament = ""2015 Alabama Crimson Tide Tournament"")
  FILTER(?university = ""Alabama Crimson Tide"")
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbp:`, `dbo:`, and `rdfs:`.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the count of universities using the `COUNT(?university)` expression.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?university a dbo:University`: This line specifies that we are looking for entities that are instances of the `dbo:University` class.
   - `?university dbo:participatedIn ?tournament`: This line specifies that we are looking for entities that have a relationship with the `dbo:participatedIn` property.
   - `FILTER(?tournament = ""2015 Alabama Crimson Tide Tournament"")`: This line filters the results to only include tournaments with the specific name.
   - `FILTER(?university = ""Alabama Crimson Tide"")`: This line filters the results to only include the university ""Alabama Crimson Tide"".


This query retrieves the count of universities that participated in the tournament won by Alabama Crimson Tide in 2015.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We use the prefixes `dbo:` and `ex:` to shorten the names of the DBpedia and example ontology properties.
2. **SELECT:** We select the properties `?state` and `?downriver` that we want to retrieve.
3. **WHERE:** We use the `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions for the query.
4. **Query Steps:**
   - **`?person dbo:born ?birthPlace`:** This line retrieves the birth place of a person using the `dbo:born` property.
   - **`?birthPlace dbo:name ?place`:** This line retrieves the name of the birth place using the `dbo:name` property.
   - **`?place dbo:name ?state`:** This line retrieves the name of the state using the `dbo:name` property.

Question: From how many different places have participants of Breeders's Cup Turf come?
Answer: The query should return the number of unique locations from which participants of the Breeders' Cup Turf have come.


```sparql
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

WHERE {
  ?participant dbo:participantOf ?event .
  ?event dbo:event ?turf .
  ?turf dbo:location ?place .
  FILTER (?place != ""unknown"")
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (`dbo:`) and RDF (`rdf:`) to make the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?place)) AS ?count` to select the count of unique locations (`?place`) and give it an alias `?count`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - `?participant dbo:participantOf ?event` : This line retrieves all participants of the event.
   - `?event dbo:event ?turf` : This line retrieves the event itself.
   - `?turf dbo:location ?place` : This line retrieves the location of the event.
   - `FILTER (?place != ""unknown"")` : This line filters out any locations that are marked as ""unknown"".

**In summary:** The query retrieves all participants of the Breeders' Cup Turf, finds their locations, and counts the unique locations from which they came.

Answer: This question cannot be answered using the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.


**Query:** 
```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(?saint) AS ?count)

```

**Explanation:**

The provided SPARQL query aims to count the number of ""Saints"" in the DBpedia Knowledge Graph. 

**Issues:**

* **No Jewish Saints:** The DBpedia Knowledge Graph does not contain information about saints venerated in Judaism. 
* **Focus on Christianity:** The query focuses on ""Saints"" which are primarily associated with Christianity. 
* **Ambiguous Term:** The term ""saint"" is ambiguous and can refer to different figures in various religions. 

**Conclusion:**

The query cannot be used to answer the question as it is based on a flawed assumption about the DBpedia Knowledge Graph's content.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?movie`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
    * **?movie dbo:writtenBy ?author:** This line retrieves movies and their corresponding authors.
    * **FILTER (?author rdfs:label = ""Monty Python""):** This filters the results to only include authors with the label ""Monty Python"".
    * **FILTER (?movie dbo:title = ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""):** This further filters the results to only include movies with the title ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"".


This query retrieves the movie title ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and its corresponding author, which is ""Monty Python"".

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `dbo:` for convenience.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT:** We use `SELECT DISTINCT ?show` to retrieve only unique show names.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?show a dbo:Episode`: This line specifies that we are looking for shows that have the `dbo:Episode` property.
   - `?show dbo:writtenBy ?writer`: This line links the show to the writer(s) using the `dbo:writtenBy` property.
   - `?writer dbo:name ?writerName`: This line extracts the writer's name from the `dbo:name` property.
   - `FILTER (regex(?writerName, ""Erik Jendresen"") || regex(?writerName, ""Graham Yost""))`: This line filters the results to include only shows where the writer's name contains either ""Erik Jendresen"" or ""Graham Yost"".

This query effectively retrieves all unique shows that have been written by either Erik Jendresen or Graham Yost.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?destination` variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.

  ?service ex:isPartOf dbo:21Vianet .
  ?group ex:product ?product .
  FILTER (str(?product) != """")
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our example ontology. This makes it easier to refer to specific concepts in the query.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve a single value, which we will call `?product`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is where the core logic of the query resides.
   - **?group ex:isPartOf dbo:AppleProductivityExperienceGroup:** This line retrieves all entities that are part of the ""Apple Productivity Experience Group"" using the ""ex:isPartOf"" relationship.
   - **?service ex:isPartOf dbo:21Vianet:** This line retrieves all entities that are part of the ""21Vianet"" using the ""ex:isPartOf"" relationship.
   - **?group ex:product ?product:** This line retrieves the ""product"" property of the entities that are part of the ""Apple Productivity Experience Group"".
   - **FILTER (str(?product) != """")**: This line ensures that the returned product is not empty.


This query effectively identifies the common product of both entities by finding the product associated with each entity and filtering out empty results.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and for the specific property we're interested in: `dbpedia:state`.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?state`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - **GRAPH <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>:** This specifies that we're querying the DBpedia ontology.

   - **?station dbpedia:location ?location:** This retrieves the location of the station using the `dbpedia:location` property.
   - **FILTER (?location = ""Wallington""):** This filters the results to only include stations located in Wallington.
   - **?station dbpedia:state ?state:** This retrieves the state of the station using the `dbpedia:state` property.

Question: Where does the network cofounded by Seewoosagur Ramgoolam air its shows?
Answer: The DBpedia Knowledge Graph does not contain information about the specific location of the shows. 

**Query:**
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?location
WHERE {
  ?location dbo:hasLocation ?show .
  ?show dbo:cofoundedBy ""Seewoosagur Ramgoolam"" .
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We use the prefixes `dbo:` for the DBpedia Ontology and `?` for variables.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT:** We select the unique `?location` variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?location dbo:hasLocation ?show` : This line matches any location that is associated with a show using the `dbo:hasLocation` property.
   - `?show dbo:cofoundedBy ""Seewoosagur Ramgoolam"" `: This line matches the shows that were founded by Seewoosagur Ramgoolam.

This query will return a list of all locations that are associated with shows founded by Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. However, it does not provide the specific location of the shows.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `rdf:` for consistency.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify the variables we want to retrieve: `?singer` (the singer of the song) and `?song` (the song itself).
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query. It contains a series of conditions to match the desired information:
   - `?song a dbo:Song`: This line identifies the `?song` as a `dbo:Song` resource.
   - `?song dbo:performedBy ?singer`: This line links the `?song` to a `?singer` who performed it.
   - `?singer dbo:name ?singerName`: This line extracts the `?singer`'s name and stores it in `?singerName`.
   - `FILTER (?singerName = ""Robin Gibb"")`: This line filters the results to only include the `?singer` whose name is ""Robin Gibb"".
   - `?song dbo:title ""Oh! Darling""`: This line ensures that the `?song` has the title ""Oh! Darling"".

This query effectively searches the DBpedia Knowledge Graph for a song with the title ""Oh! Darling"" and identifies the singer as ""Robin Gibb"".

Question: Which awards have been given to the horse who sired Triplicate?
Answer:  
```sparql

SELECT DISTINCT ?award
WHERE {
  ?horse dbo:sire ?sired .
  ?sired dbo:award ?award .
  FILTER (?award = ""Triplicate"")
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?award:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a unique value for the variable `?award`.
3. **WHERE clause:** This is the core of the query.
   - **?horse dbo:sire ?sired:** This line identifies the horse that we are interested in. We use the `dbo:sire` property to link the horse to its sire.
   - **?sired dbo:award ?award:** This line identifies the award given to the sire. We use the `dbo:award` property to link the sire to its award.
   - **FILTER (?award = ""Triplicate""):** This line filters the results to only include awards that are equal to ""Triplicate"".


This query effectively searches for awards given to the sire of Triplicate, ensuring that only unique awards are returned.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:` and `dbp:` are prefixes used to shorten the names of DBpedia ontology and resource classes.

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `SELECT ?location`: This clause specifies that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?location`.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?athlete dbp:debut ?location`: This line matches any statements where the subject is a DBpedia resource for an athlete (`?athlete`) and the predicate is `dbp:debut` (meaning ""debut""). The object of this relationship is the location where the athlete made their debut (`?location`).
   - `FILTER regex(?location, ""Deion Sanders"")`: This line filters the results to only include those where the value of `?location` contains the string ""Deion Sanders"". This ensures we only retrieve the location where Deion Sanders made his debut.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve two values: `?admin` (the administrator's name) and `?bridge` (the bridge's name).
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query. It contains a series of conditions that must be satisfied for a result to be returned.
    * **?bridge dbo:hasAdministrator ?admin:** This line retrieves the administrator associated with a bridge.
    * **FILTER (?admin rdfs:label = ""Administrator""):** This filters the results to only include administrators with the label ""Administrator"".

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:` represents the DBpedia ontology.
   - `?`: represents a variable.

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `SELECT (COUNT(?person) AS ?count)`: This selects the count of all `?person` entities and assigns it to the variable `?count`.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?person a dbo:Person`: This selects all entities with the `dbo:Person` type.
   - `FILTER (REGEX(?person, 'Janata Party', 'i'))`: This filters for entities containing the string ""Janata Party"" in their name.
   - `FILTER EXISTS { ... }`: This nested filter checks if the entity is a member of a party.
     - `?person dbo:PartyMember ?party`: This selects the `?person` and their `?party` membership.
     - `?party dbo:Party ?party_name`: This selects the `?party` and their `?party_name`.
     - `FILTER (REGEX(?party_name, 'Janata Party', 'i'))`: This filters for parties containing the string ""Janata Party"" in their name.

**In summary:** The query identifies all individuals (`?person`) that are members of a party (`?party`) and then counts the number of distinct parties they are members of.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?band:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a unique value for the variable `?band`.
3. **WHERE clause:** This is where the query logic resides.
   - **?band dbo:name ?bandName:** This line retrieves the name of the band using the `dbo:name` property.

Question: Where was Live in Detroit, MI recorded and was also palce of birth of the Bodhin Kjolhede?
Answer: The query should return the location where Live recorded their music and the city where Bodhin Kjolhede was born.


```sparql
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/ontology/>
SELECT ?location ?city
WHERE {
  ?artist dbo:recordedAt ?location .

  FILTER (?city = ""Detroit, MI"")
  FILTER (dbo:recordedAt( ?artist ) = ""Detroit, MI"")
  FILTER (dbo:birthPlace( ?artist ) = ""Detroit, MI"")
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our example ontology. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT:** We specify the variables we want to retrieve: `?location` and `?city`.
3. **WHERE:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
   - **?artist dbo:recordedAt ?location:** This line retrieves the location where the artist recorded their music.
   - **?artist dbo:birthPlace ?city:** This line retrieves the city where the artist was born.
   - **FILTER (?location = ""Detroit, MI"")**: This line filters the results to only include locations that are ""Detroit, MI"".
   - **FILTER (?city = ""Detroit, MI"")**: This line filters the results to only include cities that are ""Detroit, MI"".
   - **FILTER (dbo:recordedAt( ?artist ) = ""Detroit, MI"")**: This line filters the results to only include artists whose recorded location is ""Detroit, MI"".

SELECT ?label
WHERE {
  ?item dbo:producedBy ""If"".
  ?item dbo:label ?label.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and DBpedia Resource (dbp) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?label` variable.
3. **WHERE:** This clause defines the conditions for matching results.
    * `?item dbo:producedBy ""If""`: This line matches any item that is produced by the band ""If"".
    * `?item dbo:label ?label`: This line matches the item and retrieves its label.
4. **LIMIT 1:** This clause limits the results to only one match, ensuring we get the label of the first item produced by ""If"".

This query effectively retrieves the label of the first item produced by the band ""If"" from the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.

WHERE {
  ?maintainer dbo:maintains ?bridge .
  ?bridge dbo:location ?land .
  FILTER (?land = ""Malaysia"" && ex:juniorHockeyLeague(?land) )
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our custom ontology (if applicable).
   - `dbo:` for DBpedia Ontology.
   - `ex:` for our custom ontology.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify the variables we want to retrieve:
   - `?maintainer`: The name of the maintainer.
   - `?land`: The land where the bridge is located.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query:
   - `?maintainer dbo:maintains ?bridge` : This line retrieves the maintainer of a bridge.
   - `?bridge dbo:location ?land` : This line retrieves the location of a bridge.
   - `FILTER (?land = ""Malaysia"" && ex:juniorHockeyLeague(?land))`: This line filters the results to only include land that is ""Malaysia"" and is associated with the junior hockey league.

**Key Points:**

- **Data Relationships:** The query leverages the relationships between DBpedia entities (maintainer, bridge, location) to find the desired information.
- **Filtering:** The `FILTER` clause is used to refine the results based on specific criteria.
- **Uniqueness:** The query retrieves unique results by ensuring that the land is associated with the junior hockey league.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for the DBpedia ontology and the dbo namespace. This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT:** We use the `SELECT DISTINCT` clause to retrieve only unique values for the `?trainer` variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause contains the query logic:
   - **?trainer dbpedia:name dbo:trainers ?trainer:** This line retrieves the `?trainer` variable by matching it with the `dbpedia:name` property of the `dbo:trainers` property.
   - **FILTER(?trainer = ""Shinya Aoki""):** This line filters the results to only include those where the `?trainer` variable matches the value ""Shinya Aoki"".

This query is not suitable for the question. Here's why:

* **Focus on ""fought by""**: The query focuses on the relationship ""fought by"" but doesn't explicitly mention Ali Habib Mahmud. 
* **Missing subject**: The query lacks a subject to link to Ali Habib Mahmud. 

Here's a revised query that addresses these issues:

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT ?battle ?date ?location ?opponent`**: This line specifies the variables we want to retrieve: `?battle`, `?date`, `?location`, and `?opponent`. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures we only get unique results.
2. **`WHERE { ... }`**: This block defines the conditions for the query.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?show) AS ?count)` to retrieve the count of TV shows.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?show dbo:creator ?creator .`: This line identifies TV shows by their creator.
   - `?creator dbo:name ?name .`: This line extracts the creator's name from the `dbo:name` property.
   - `FILTER (regex(?name, ""Simon Fuller"", ""i""))`: This line filters the results to include only those where the creator's name contains ""Simon Fuller"".

Answer:  The number of things belonging to the phylum Chordata.


```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(?thing) AS ?count)
WHERE {
  ?thing a dbo:Chordate .
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT (COUNT(?thing) AS ?count)`:** This line specifies the output of the query. We want to count the number of things, which we'll represent as `?count`.
2. **`WHERE { ?thing a dbo:Chordate . }`:** This line defines the conditions for the query. 
   - `?thing`: This is a variable representing any thing we're interested in.
   - `a dbo:Chordate .`: This means we're looking for things that have the property `dbo:Chordate` and are of type `dbo:Chordate`. 

**Key Points:**

* **Prefixes:** We use the prefixes `dbo:` for the DBpedia Ontology and `?` for variables.
* **`COUNT`:** The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of matching results.
* **`WHERE` Clause:** The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions for the query.

  ?person foaf:name ?name .
  ?person dbo:constituentOf ?constituency .
  FILTER (?constituency = ""Jadavpur"")
  ?person dbo:religion ?religion .
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo), RDF Schema (rdfs), and Friend of a Friend (foaf). This makes the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?religion` variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
    * **?person foaf:name ?name:** This line retrieves the name of the person using the `foaf:name` property.
    * **?person dbo:constituentOf ?constituency:** This line retrieves the constituency of the person using the `dbo:constituentOf` property.
    * **FILTER (?constituency = ""Jadavpur""):** This line filters the results to only include people who are constituents of the ""Jadavpur"" constituency.
    * **?person dbo:religion ?religion:** This line retrieves the religion of the person using the `dbo:religion` property.

This query effectively retrieves the religion of all people who are constituents of the Jadavpur constituency.

   - `(?person) AS ?count` selects the variable `?person` and assigns it the alias `?count`.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause defines the conditions for the query:
   - `?person dbp:trained ?trained` indicates that we're looking for people who have trained someone.
   - `?trained dbp:trained dbp:person` ensures that `?trained` is a person.
   - `FILTER (dbp:location(?trained) = ""Wisconsin"")` filters the results to only include people who trained wrestlers in Wisconsin.

**In summary:** The query searches for people who have trained wrestlers in Wisconsin, counts the number of such people, and returns the count as a unique result.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT ?show` to specify that we want to retrieve a single variable named `?show`, which will represent the name of the television show.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - `?show dbo:openingTheme ?theme` : This line retrieves the television show by matching the `dbo:openingTheme` property to a specific value.
   - `?theme dbo:album ?album` : This line retrieves the album associated with the opening theme.
   - `FILTER (?album = ""Cheers"")` : This line filters the results to only include albums that have the value ""Cheers"".


**In summary, the query searches for a television show whose opening theme's album is ""Cheers"" and returns the name of that show.**

```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs) to make the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variable we want to retrieve, which is the total number of destinations. We use the alias `?totalDestinations` for clarity.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause contains the main logic of the query.
    * **`?airline rdf:type dbo:Airline`:** This line selects all entities that are of type ""Airline"" according to the DBpedia Ontology.
    * **`?airline dbo:hasDestination ?destination`:** This line selects all airlines and their destinations.
    * **`FILTER (?destination = ""Mediterranean Sea"")`:** This line filters the results to only include destinations that are ""Mediterranean Sea"".
    * **`?airline dbo:hasDestination ?otherDestination`:** This line selects all airlines and their other destinations.

This query retrieves all airlines with a destination of ""Mediterranean Sea"" and then counts the number of other destinations for each airline.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and DBpedia Resource (dbp) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve two values: `?scientist` (the scientist) and `?supervisor` (the doctoral supervisor).
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - `?scientist dbo:doctoralSupervisor ?supervisor` : This line matches the relationship between a scientist and their doctoral supervisor.
   - `FILTER (lang(?supervisor) = ""en"")`: This filters the results to only include supervisors whose language is English.
   - `FILTER (dbp:name(?scientist) = ""Georg Meissner"")`: This filters the results to only include supervisors associated with Georg Meissner.

This query will return a list of unique scientists who were doctoral supervisors of Georg Meissner.

Question: In which company is Raymond Conner at an important position?
Answer: The query should return the name of the company where Raymond Conner holds an important position.


```sparql
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

  ?person dbo:name ?personName .
  FILTER (regex(?personName, ""Raymond Conner"", ""i""))
  FILTER (regex(?company, ""Company"", ""i""))
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (`dbo:`) and DBpedia Resource (`dbp:`) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?company`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - `?person dbo:atCompany ?company` : This line retrieves the company where the person is working.
   - `?person dbo:name ?personName` : This line retrieves the name of the person.
   - `FILTER (regex(?personName, ""Raymond Conner"", ""i""))` : This line filters the results to only include people named ""Raymond Conner"".
   - `FILTER (regex(?company, ""Company"", ""i""))` : This line filters the results to only include companies containing the word ""Company"".

This query effectively searches for the company where ""Raymond Conner"" is working, filtering for companies containing the word ""Company"".

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefix:** We start by defining the prefix for DBpedia: `dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>`. This makes it easier to refer to DBpedia entities and properties.

2. **SELECT:** We use `SELECT ?team` to specify that we want to retrieve a single variable named `?team` which will hold the name of the team.

3. **WHERE:** This clause contains the filtering conditions.

4. **?player:** We use `?player` to refer to the player entities.

5. **dbpedia:name:** We use `dbpedia:name` to link the player entities to their names.

6. **dbpedia:playedFor:** We use `dbpedia:playedFor` to link the player entities to the teams they played for.

7. **FILTER:** We use `FILTER` to filter the results to only include teams that contain the word ""Team"" in their name.

Question: What is the draft team of the Antoine Bibeau and also had player named Nathan Dempsey?
Answer: 
```sparql
SELECT ?draftTeam
WHERE {
  ?team a dbo:DraftTeam .
  ?team dbo:draftTeamMember ?player .
  ?player dbo:name ?playerName .
  FILTER (regex(?playerName, ""Antoine Bibeau"", ""i""))
  FILTER (regex(?player, ""Nathan Dempsey"", ""i""))
  ?team dbo:draftTeamMember ?player .
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify relevant properties:**
   - `dbo:DraftTeam`: Represents the draft team.
   - `dbo:draftTeamMember`: Represents a member of the draft team.
   - `dbo:name`: Represents the name of a person.

2. **Structure the query:**
   - `SELECT ?draftTeam`: Selects the draft team.
   - `WHERE { ... }`: Defines the conditions for matching results.
   - `?team a dbo:DraftTeam`: Matches any entity with the label ""DraftTeam"" from the DBpedia ontology.
   - `?team dbo:draftTeamMember ?player`: Matches the draft team with a member.
   - `?player dbo:name ?playerName`: Matches the member with their name.
   - `FILTER (regex(?playerName, ""Antoine Bibeau"", ""i""))`: Filters for players whose name contains ""Antoine Bibeau"".
   - `FILTER (regex(?player, ""Nathan Dempsey"", ""i""))`: Filters for players whose name contains ""Nathan Dempsey"".
   - `?team dbo:draftTeamMember ?player`: Matches the draft team with a member again.

3. **Use proper SPARQL syntax:**
   - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `?`, `a`, `dbo:`, `?player`, `dbo:name`, `?playerName`, `FILTER`, `regex` are used correctly.

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify relevant properties:**
   - `a dbo:River`: This property identifies the subject as a river.
   - `a dbo:Location`: This property identifies the subject as a location.
   - `?river ?riverStart ?riverStartLocation`: This pattern matches the relationship between a river and its starting location.

   - `FILTER(?riverStartLocation = ""Lebrsnik"")`: This filter ensures that only rivers starting in Lebrsnik are returned.

2. **Structure the query:**
   - The query uses a `SELECT DISTINCT` clause to retrieve unique results.
   - The query uses a `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions for matching results.
   - The query uses a `?river` variable to represent the river.
   - The query uses a `?riverStart` variable to represent the starting location of the river.

   - `rdfs:` represents the RDF Schema vocabulary.
   - `ex:` represents the Exemplary Data vocabulary.
   - `skos:` represents the SKOS vocabulary.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the count of unique genres using the `COUNT` function and alias it as `?genreCount`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause defines the conditions for matching the data.
   - `?game a dbo:VideoGame`: This selects all triples where the subject is a video game.
   - `?game dbo:publishedBy ?publisher`: This selects all video games and their publishers.
   - `?publisher dbo:name ?publisherName`: This selects the publisher's name.
   - `FILTER (?publisherName = ""Titus Software"")`: This filters the results to only include publishers named ""Titus Software"".

   - `dbo:` represents the DBpedia ontology.
   - `rdf:` represents the RDF data model.
   - `rdfs:` represents the RDF Schema.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?b) AS ?count)` to select the count of the entities that match our query.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?b a dbo:Bacillus` : This line specifies that we are looking for entities that are instances of the `dbo:Bacillus` class.
   - `?b dbo:domain ?domain` : This line specifies that we are looking for the domain of each entity.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:`: Represents the DBpedia Ontology namespace.
   - `ex:`: Represents an example ontology (not used in the query).

2. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `SELECT ?school`: Specifies that we want to retrieve a variable named `?school` which will hold the name of the high school.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?person dbo:school ?school`: This is the main query condition. It matches triples where:
     - `?person` is a DBpedia entity (likely a person).
     - `dbo:school` is a property of that entity.
     - `?school` is the value of the `dbo:school` property.
   - `FILTER regex(?school, ""Ed Podolak"")`: This filters the results to only include those where the `?school` value contains the name ""Ed Podolak"".

**Important Notes:**

- The query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph has data about Ed Podolak's education.
- The query uses a simple regex pattern to match the name ""Ed Podolak"". You might need to adjust this pattern if the name is different or if there are multiple matches.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `dbo:` for convenience.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the variable `?party` which will hold the name of the winning party.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - **`?party a dbo:PoliticalParty`:** This line asserts that the subject of our query must be a political party.
   - **`?party dbo:WonGeneralElection ?electionYear`:** This line asserts that the party won a general election. The `?electionYear` variable will hold the year of the election.
   - **`FILTER (?electionYear = 2004)`:** This line filters the results to only include elections in 2004.
   - **`?party dbo:WonStateElection ?stateElection`:** This line asserts that the party won a state election.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and Wikidata: `wd:`.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT` to specify the output. We want to count the number of interests, so we use `COUNT(?interest) AS ?count`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause defines the conditions for matching results.
   - `?subject wdt:P31 wd:Q10777777`: This line selects the subject of the query, which is the philosopher whose primary interest is Metaphysics. We use `wdt:P31` to indicate the ""primary interest"" property and `wd:Q10777777` to refer to the Wikidata ID of the philosopher.
   - `?subject wdt:P17 ?interest`: This line selects the interest of the philosopher. We use `wdt:P17` to indicate the ""interest"" property.
   - `FILTER(?interest = ""Metaphysics"")`: This line filters the results to only include interests that are equal to ""Metaphysics"".

This query retrieves the count of interests for the philosopher whose primary interest is Metaphysics.

Question: How many races have the horses bred by Jacques Van't Hart participated in?
Answer: The query should return the number of races where horses bred by Jacques Van't Hart have participated.

```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for the DBpedia ontology (`dbpedia:`) and the dbo namespace (`dbo:`) for easier reference.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?race) AS ?count)` to retrieve the count of races.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause defines the conditions for matching results:
   - `?horse dbpedia:bredBy ?breeder` : This line links the horse to its breeder using the `dbpedia:bredBy` property.
   - `?horse dbpedia:participatedIn ?race` : This line links the horse to the races it has participated in using the `dbpedia:participatedIn` property.
   - `?breeder dbpedia:name ?breederName` : This line retrieves the name of the breeder using the `dbpedia:name` property.
   - `FILTER(?breederName = ""Jacques Van't Hart"")` : This line filters the results to only include races where the breeder is ""Jacques Van't Hart"".


This query effectively identifies all horses bred by Jacques Van't Hart and counts the number of races they have participated in.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT ?genre`**: This line specifies that we want to retrieve the value of the variable `?genre`.
2. **`WHERE { ... }`**: This block defines the conditions for the query to return results.
3. **`?band a dbo:Band`**: This line identifies the subject of the query as a ""Band"" entity. The `dbo:` prefix is used to refer to the ""dbo"" namespace, which is a standard namespace for the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.
4. **`?band dbo:hometown ?town`**: This line identifies the ""hometown"" property of the ""Band"" entity. The `?town` variable represents the value of the ""hometown"" property.
5. **`FILTER (?town = ""County Westmeath"")`**: This line filters the results to only include bands whose hometown is ""County Westmeath"".
6. **`?band dbo:genre ?genre`**: This line identifies the ""genre"" property of the ""Band"" entity. The `?genre` variable represents the value of the ""genre"" property.

This query retrieves all bands with a hometown of ""County Westmeath"" and then extracts the genre of each band.

  ?station dbo:name ?name .
  ?station dbo:location ?location .

  FILTER (?name = ""Duddeston"" || ?name = ""Bordesley"")
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `rdf:` for readability.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?borough` variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - **`?station a dbo:RailwayStation`:** This line identifies the subject as a railway station using the `dbo:RailwayStation` class.
   - **`?station dbo:name ?name`:** This line retrieves the station name using the `dbo:name` property.
   - **`?station dbo:location ?location`:** This line retrieves the station location using the `dbo:location` property.
   - **`?location dbo:borough ?borough`:** This line retrieves the borough of the location using the `dbo:borough` property.
   - **`FILTER (?name = ""Duddeston"" || ?name = ""Bordesley"")`:** This line filters the results to only include stations with names ""Duddeston"" or ""Bordesley"".

This query effectively searches for railway stations with names matching ""Duddeston"" or ""Bordesley"", retrieves their location, and then extracts the borough associated with that location.

2. **SELECT:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the `?deathPlace` variable.
3. **WHERE:** This clause defines the conditions for matching results.
   - `?person dbo:deathPlace ?deathPlace` : This line matches any statements where a person is mentioned and their `deathPlace` is also mentioned.
   - `FILTER (REGEX(?deathPlace, ""Marina Pankova"") || REGEX(?deathPlace, ""Viktor Ulyanich""))`: This line filters the results to only include those where the `deathPlace` matches either ""Marina Pankova"" or ""Viktor Ulyanich"".

Answer:  The commander of the Battle of Brownstown is **John Brown**.


```sparql
SELECT ?commander
WHERE {
  ?commander a dbo:Person .
  ?commander dbo:foughtAt ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Brownstown"" .
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT ?commander`**: This line specifies that we want to retrieve a variable named `?commander` which will hold the value of the commander's name.
2. **`WHERE { ... }`**: This block defines the conditions for the query to return results.
3. **`?commander a dbo:Person`**: This line indicates that we are looking for a subject (`?commander`) that is an instance of the `dbo:Person` class. This is a standard way to identify people in DBpedia.
4. **`?commander dbo:foughtAt ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Brownstown""`**: This line specifies that the subject (`?commander`) should have a property called `dbo:foughtAt` with a value that points to the resource `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Brownstown`. This links the commander to the specific battle.

This query effectively searches for a person who is associated with the `dbo:foughtAt` property and whose value is the `Battle of Brownstown`.

Question: Who was once married to both Kelly Brook and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley?
Answer:  **This is a tricky question that requires a bit of detective work.  You'll need to use DBpedia to find the individuals and their relationships.**

**Here's how to approach it:**

1. **Identify relevant properties:** We need to find the individuals involved and their relationships.
2. **Structure the query:** We'll use SPARQL to query the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.
3. **Use prefixes:** We'll use prefixes to make the query easier to read and understand.
4. **Retrieve unique results:** We'll use the `FILTER` clause to ensure we only get unique results.

}
UNION
SELECT ?birthPlace
WHERE {
  ?person dbp:name ""Qadir Huseynov"" .
  ?person dbo:birthPlace ?birthPlace .
}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia's ontology and resource:
   - `dbo:` for DBpedia's ontology properties.
   - `dbp:` for DBpedia resource.

2. **Main Query:** We use a `SELECT` clause to retrieve the `?birthPlace` variable.
   - We use a `WHERE` clause to filter for individuals with the given names.
   - `?person dbp:name ""Liudmila Privivkova""`: This line searches for individuals with the name ""Liudmila Privivkova"" in the DBpedia resource.
   - `?person dbo:birthPlace ?birthPlace`: This line searches for the `birthPlace` property of the individual.

3. **Union:** We use a `UNION` clause to combine the results from two separate queries.
   - The first query searches for Liudmila Privivkova.
   - The second query searches for Qadir Huseynov.

4. **Unique Results:** The `SELECT` clause retrieves unique results for each individual.

SELECT DISTINCT ?sport
WHERE {
  ?school dbo:location ?location .
  FILTER (regex(?location, ""Vashi, India""))

}
```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our example ontology. This makes the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?sport:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a unique list of sports.
3. **WHERE clause:** This is where the query logic resides.
   - **?school dbo:location ?location:** This line retrieves the location of a school using the `dbo:location` property.
   - **FILTER (regex(?location, ""Vashi, India"")):** This line filters the results to only include schools located in Vashi, India.
   - **?school dbo:hasSport ?sport:** This line retrieves the sports played at a school using the `dbo:hasSport` property.

**Note:** This query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph contains information about schools and their sports.

Question: Did Trish Stratus train Christina Crawford?
```
SELECT DISTINCT ?trainer ?athlete WHERE {
  ?trainer a dbo:Person .
  ?athlete a dbo:Person .

}
```

This query is not suitable for the question. Here's why:

* **Missing Relationship:** The query focuses on the ""trained"" relationship, but the question asks about Trish Stratus training Christina Crawford. 
* **No Direct Connection:** The query doesn't explicitly link Trish Stratus and Christina Crawford.


Here's a revised SPARQL query that addresses the question:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?trainer ?athlete WHERE {
  ?trainer a dbo:Person .
  ?athlete a dbo:Person .
  ?trainer dbo:trained ?athlete .
  FILTER(?athlete = <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christina_Crawford> )
  FILTER(?trainer = <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trish_Stratus> )
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT ?trainer ?athlete`**: This selects the unique values of the `trainer` and `athlete` variables.
2. **`WHERE { ... }`**: This defines the conditions for the query.
3. **`?trainer a dbo:Person`**: This specifies that the `trainer` variable should be a person.
4. **`?athlete a dbo:Person`**: This specifies that the `athlete` variable should be a person.
5. **`?trainer dbo:trained ?athlete`**: This specifies that the `trainer` variable trained the `athlete` variable.
6. **`FILTER(?athlete = <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christina_Crawford>)`**: This filters the results to only include the athlete Christina Crawford.
7. **`FILTER(?trainer = <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trish_","SELECT DISTINCT ?trainer ?athlete WHERE {

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the values of the variables `?place` and `?style`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
   - **?place dbo:hasArchitecturalStyle ?style:** This line retrieves all places that have an architectural style using the `dbo:hasArchitecturalStyle` property.
   - **FILTER (regex(?style, ""Greek Revival"", ""i"")):** This line filters the results to only include places with architectural styles that contain the string ""Greek Revival"" in them.
   - **FILTER (dbo:hasPlace ?place):** This line filters the results to only include places that have a place property.

This query will return a list of places that have the Greek Revival architectural style.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and the specific ontology we're querying.
   - `prefix dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>`
   - `prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>`

2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?unit:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a unique value for the variable `?unit`.

3. **WHERE clause:** This is where the query logic resides.
   - `?unit a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MilitaryUnit>`: This line indicates that we're looking for a resource that is an instance of the `MilitaryUnit` class.
   - `?unit wdt:P31 wd:Q10477777`: This line specifies that the `?unit` should be linked to the Wikidata property `P31` with the Wikidata ID `Q10477777`. This property represents the location of a military unit.
   - `FILTER (STRSTARTS(STR(?unit), ""Arlington County, Virginia""))`: This line filters the results to include only units whose name contains ""Arlington County, Virginia"".

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We use the prefixes `dbo:` for the DBpedia ontology and `?` for variables.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the variable `?territory` which will hold the territory name.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - We start by finding a conflict (`?conflict`) that has a commander (`?commander`).
   - We then find the commander's name (`?commanderName`) and filter for the commander's name being ""Feng Zicai"".
   - Finally, we find the territory of the conflict (`?territory`).
4. **LIMIT Clause:** We limit the results to only one row, which is the territory of the conflict.

1. **Identify relevant properties:** We need to find entities that are located on the borders of Shimsa Plateau. This could be:
    * **geo:borders:** This property represents the geographical boundaries of a location.
    * **geo:location:** This property represents the location of an entity.
    * **geo:name:** This property represents the name of a location.

2. **Structure the query:**
    * **Prefixes:** Define prefixes for DBpedia entities:

  ?appliance dbo:successor ?successor .
  ?successor dbo:maker ?maker .
  FILTER (?maker = ""Foxconn"")
  FILTER (?successor = ""PlayStation 4"")
}
```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for the DBpedia namespace (`dbo:`).
2. **SELECT DISTINCT:** We use `SELECT DISTINCT ?appliance` to retrieve only unique values for the variable `?appliance`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause contains the conditions for matching the query:
   - `?appliance a dbo:InformationAppliance`: This line specifies that the variable `?appliance` should be an instance of the `dbo:InformationAppliance` class.
   - `?appliance dbo:successor ?successor`: This line specifies that the variable `?appliance` has a property `dbo:successor` that points to another entity, which we'll call `?successor`.
   - `?successor dbo:maker ?maker`: This line specifies that the variable `?successor` has a property `dbo:maker` that points to another entity, which we'll call `?maker`.
   - `FILTER (?maker = ""Foxconn"")`: This line filters the results to only include entities where the `?maker` property is equal to ""Foxconn"".
   - `FILTER (?successor = ""PlayStation 4"")`: This line filters the results to only include entities where the `?successor` property is equal to ""PlayStation 4"".

This query effectively searches for an `InformationAppliance` that has a successor named ""PlayStation 4"" and a maker named ""Foxconn"". The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique results are returned.","SELECT DISTINCT ?appliance

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and the ontology we're using.
2. **SELECT:** We specify that we want to count the number of awards.
3. **WHERE:** This clause defines the conditions for the query.
   - **?person:** This variable represents a person.
   - **dbo:died ?date:** This clause retrieves the date of death for a person.
   - **dbo:hasAward ?award:** This clause retrieves the awards given to a person.
   - **FILTER (?date = ""2023-01-01""):** This clause filters the results to only include awards given in 2023.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `rdfs:` for the DBpedia and RDF Schema vocabularies respectively.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT:** We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve only unique writers.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions for matching triples.
4. **?writer a dbo:Person:** This line identifies the writer as a person using the `dbo:Person` class.
5. **?writer dbo:wrote ?comic:** This line specifies that the writer has written a comic.
6. **FILTER (?comic rdfs:label = ""The Adventures of Tintin""):** This line filters the results to only include comics with the label ""The Adventures of Tintin"".

SELECT ?award ?award_year
WHERE {
  ?producer ex:executiveProducer ?timeSeries .

```
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our custom ontology. 
   - `dbo:` for DBpedia Ontology.
   - `ex:` for our custom ontology.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify the properties we want to retrieve:
   - `?award`: The name of the award.
   - `?award_year`: The year the award was won.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query:
   - `?producer ex:executiveProducer ?timeSeries` : This line identifies the producer of the show.
   - `?timeSeries dbo:award ?award` : This line identifies the awards won by the show.
   - `?award dbo:year ?award_year` : This line extracts the year of the award.

**Important Notes:**

- This query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph contains information about awards won by the executive producer of a show.
- The query is designed to retrieve unique awards. 
- The query is specific to the DBpedia Knowledge Graph and may need to be adapted for other knowledge graphs.

  FILTER regex(?o, ""Willem-Alexander"")
  FILTER regex(?o, ""Fredis Refunjol"")
}
```

This query is not correct. Here's why and how to fix it:

**Issues with the provided query:**

* **Redundant `?s ?p ?o` clauses:** The query includes multiple `?s ?p ?o` clauses, which are unnecessary and lead to redundant results.
* **Missing `FILTER` clause:** The query lacks a `FILTER` clause to specify the desired relationship between the subject and the object.
* **Unclear subject and predicate:** The query doesn't explicitly define the subject and predicate for the relationship.


**Corrected SPARQL Query:**

```sparql

  FILTER regex(?o, ""Fredis Refunjol"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`SELECT DISTINCT ?leader1 ?leader2`:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve distinct values for the variables `?leader1` and `?leader2`.
* **`WHERE { ... }`:** This block defines the conditions for the query.
* **`?s ?p ?o`:** This is a general pattern for a triple in the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.

Question: Who wrote the play in which a character called Stella Kowalski exists?
Answer:  The play is ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Stella Kowalski is a character in it.


```sparql
SELECT ?author ?play
WHERE {
  ?author a dbo:Person .
  ?play dbo:title ?title .
  ?play dbo:hasCharacter ?character .
  ?character dbo:name ?characterName .
  FILTER (?characterName = ""Stella Kowalski"")
  FILTER (?title = ""A Streetcar Named Desire"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia: `dbpedia:` and `dbo:` for convenience.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify the variables we want to retrieve: `?author` (the author of the play) and `?play` (the play's title).
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query. It uses a series of nested statements to find the desired information:
   - **`?author a dbo:Person`:** This line identifies the author as a person.
   - **`?play dbo:title ?title`:** This line identifies the play's title.
   - **`?play dbo:hasCharacter ?character`:** This line identifies the play as having a character.
   - **`?character dbo:name ?characterName`:** This line identifies the character's name.
   - **`FILTER (?characterName = ""Stella Kowalski"")`:** This line filters the results to only include characters named ""Stella Kowalski"".
   - **`FILTER (?title = ""A Streetcar Named Desire"")`:** This line filters the results to only include plays titled ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".

This query effectively retrieves the author of the play ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and the name of the character ""Stella Kowalski"" within the DBpedia Knowledge Graph.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the value of the field variable.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - **?subject dbo:field ?field:** This line searches for a subject (represented by a variable `?subject`) that has a field (represented by a variable `?field`) associated with it.
   - **?subject dbp:name ""Sylvain Lvi"":** This line ensures that the subject is ""Sylvain Lvi"" by checking if the subject has the property ""dbp:name"" with the value ""Sylvain Lvi"".

This query will return a list of all fields associated with the DBpedia resource ""Sylvain Lvi"".

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for the DBpedia Ontology (`dbo:`) and our example ontology (`ex:`) for easier reference.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT` to retrieve the count of games. We use `(?game) AS ?count` to assign the count to a variable named `?count`.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions for the query.
   - `?game dbo:publishedBy ""Interplay Entertainment""`: This condition filters for games where the `dbo:publishedBy` property is associated with the value ""Interplay Entertainment"".


This query will return a single result, the number of different games published by Interplay Entertainment.

Ensure that the query uses proper SPARQL syntax, includes prefixes, and retrieves unique results. Step-by-step: Identify relevant properties and structure the query accordingly.
Output only the SPARQL query
Question: Foxconn makes how many things?
Answer: The number of things Foxconn makes is not explicitly stated in DBpedia. 

**Query:**
```sparql
SELECT ?count
WHERE {
  ?company a dbo:Company .
  ?company dbo:makes ?thing .
  FILTER(?thing = ""thing"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:**
   - `dbo:` is a prefix for the DBpedia ontology.
   - `?` is a placeholder for the variable we want to retrieve the count.

2. **Query Structure:**
   - **SELECT ?count:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a variable named `?count`.
   - **WHERE:** This clause defines the conditions for the query to be satisfied.
   - **?company a dbo:Company:** This line selects all entities that are instances of the `dbo:Company` class.
   - **?company dbo:makes ?thing:** This line selects all entities that are instances of the `dbo:makes` property and have a value of `?thing`.
   - **FILTER(?thing = ""thing""):** This line filters the results to only include entities where the `?thing` variable is equal to ""thing"".

**Note:** This query is not designed to answer the specific question about Foxconn's production output. It is a general query that retrieves the number of things that are associated with a company.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and its resources.
   - `dbo:` represents DBpedia Ontology properties.
   - `dbp:` represents DBpedia resources.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify the variables we want to retrieve:
   - `?origin`: The national origin of the company.
   - `?name`: The name of the company.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query:
   - We use `?company` to refer to the company entities.
   - `dbp:name` retrieves the name of the company.
   - `dbo:nationalOrigin` retrieves the national origin of the company.
   - We use `FILTER` to ensure that the origin is not empty.
   - We repeat the same pattern for Hirth Acrostar.

Answer: 
```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(?launchSite)) AS ?count
WHERE {
  ?rocket launchSite ?launchSite.
  FILTER(?launchSite = ""Cape Canaveral Air Force Station"")

   - `prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>`.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We use `SELECT (COUNT(?launchSite)) AS ?count` to select the count of the `launchSite` property.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `?rocket launchSite ?launchSite.` This line indicates that we are looking for rockets that have a `launchSite` property.
   - `FILTER(?launchSite = ""Cape Canaveral Air Force Station"")` This line filters the results to only include rockets launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

**In summary:** This query searches for all rockets that have a `launchSite` property and filters the results to only include those launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It then counts the number of such rockets and returns the count as the result.

```



**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for the DBpedia Ontology (dbo), RDF Schema (rdfs), and our example ontology (ex). This makes the query easier to read and understand.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We specify that we want to retrieve the artist and genre.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This is the core of the query. It defines the conditions for matching results:
   - **?artist a dbo:MusicalArtist:** This selects all artists that are instances of the dbo:MusicalArtist class.
   - **?artist dbo:associatedWith ?group:** This selects artists and their associated groups.
   - **?group dbo:name ?group_name:** This selects the name of the group.
   - **FILTER (?group_name = ""The Shirelles""):** This filters the results to only include groups named ""The Shirelles"".
   - **?artist dbo:genre ?genre:** This selects the genre of each artist.

**Note:** This query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph contains information about artists, musical groups, and their genres.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia and our example ontology. This makes it easier to refer to specific concepts in the query.
2. **SELECT Clause:** We use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variable we want to retrieve, which is the number of members. We use the alias `?number` to give it a more readable name.
3. **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause contains the query logic.
   - `?member dbo:memberOf ex:EuropeanGoFederation`: This line matches any statements where the `?member` variable is a member of the `ex:EuropeanGoFederation` entity. 
4. **COUNT:** The `COUNT(?member)` function counts the number of matching entities.

  ?company dbo:chairman ?chairman .
  ?chairman dbp:name ?name .
  ?chairman dbp:hasHomeStadium ?stadium .
  FILTER (regex(?name, ""Leonid Fedun"", ""i""))
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and DBpedia Resource (dbp) to simplify the query.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?stadium:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve unique values for the variable `?stadium`.

**Explanation:**

1. **Prefixes:** We start by defining prefixes for DBpedia Ontology (dbo) and RDF Schema (rdfs). This makes it easier to refer to specific properties and classes.
2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?car:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve a unique list of car names.
3. **WHERE clause:** This is where the query logic resides.
   - **?car dbo:hasProperty dbo:engineType:** This clause selects all entities (cars) that have a property called ""engineType"" with the value ""V8"".
   - **FILTER (?car dbo:engineType = ""V8""):** This filters the results to only include cars with the ""V8"" engine type.
   - **?car dbo:hasProperty dbo:name:** This clause selects the car name for each car that meets the previous conditions.

This query effectively retrieves a list of unique car names that have a V8 engine.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variable we want to retrieve, which is the count of distinct artists.
3. **WHERE Clause:** This clause contains the main logic of the query.
   - `?artist dbo:painted ?character` : This line specifies that we are looking for statements where an artist (`?artist`) has painted a character (`?character`).
   - `FILTER(?character rdfs:label = ""Sarah Jane Adventures""^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>)` : This filter ensures that we only consider characters named ""Sarah Jane Adventures"".

**Note:** This query assumes that the DBpedia Knowledge Graph contains information about artists and characters in the ""Sarah Jane Adventures"" series.

```

This query is not correct. Here's why and how to fix it:

**Issues with the provided query:**

* **Incorrect Property Usage:** The query uses `dbo:hasShrine` and `dbo:isShrineOf` which are not standard DBpedia properties for saints. 
* **Unclear Filtering:** The `FILTER` clauses are not well-structured and don't clearly filter for the desired relationship.
* **Redundant Filtering:** The query includes multiple `FILTER` clauses that are redundant and don't improve the query's efficiency.

**Revised Query:**

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT ?saint ?tomb`:** This line specifies that we want to retrieve distinct values for the `?saint` and `?tomb` variables.
2. **`WHERE { ... }`:** This block defines the query's conditions.
3. **`?saint a dbo:Saint`:** This clause ensures that the `?saint` variable represents a saint.

2. **SELECT Clause:** We select the `?nationality` variable, which will hold the nationality of the golfer.
3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - **GRAPH:** We specify the DBpedia graph for Person entities (`dbpedia.org/ontology/Person`).
   - **?person:** We use a variable `?person` to represent a golf player.
   - **a dbo:Person:** We indicate that the `?person` is a dbo:Person.
   - **?person dbo:name ?name:** We link the `?person` to their name using the `dbo:name` property.
   - **?person dbo:nationality ?nationality:** We link the `?person` to their nationality using the `dbo:nationality` property.
   - **FILTER (?name = ""Tiger Woods""):** We filter the results to only include the golfer named ""Tiger Woods"".
